**Turn an Excel spreadsheet and a Word template into hundreds of personalised documents — in one run, on your own machine.**

Doc Gen Studio is a free, open-source desktop app for teams that need to produce contracts, letters, or notices at scale. No cloud subscription. No mail-merge fragility. No Python scripts to babysit. Just load your data, map your fields, and generate.

---

## Why Doc Gen Studio?

- **Your data stays local.** Excel files, Word templates, and generated outputs never leave your machine. No accounts, no uploads, no SaaS billing.
- **Batch in minutes, not hours.** Generate Word docs, PDFs, and email drafts from a single workbook run. One click replaces hours of copy-paste.
- **Safe to hand to anyone.** A guided four-step workflow means non-technical team members can run generation without touching scripts or configuration files.
- **Catch mistakes before you generate.** Live mapping preview, first-row filename preview, and unmapped-token warnings catch errors before a full run.
- **Flexible email output.** Export email drafts as one combined DOCX, individual DOCX files, ready-to-send `.eml` files, or Outlook `.msg` files — whichever fits your workflow.
- **Respects your OS.** Follows your system light/dark theme. Full application menu with keyboard shortcuts.

## Who Is It For?

- Legal, grants, and contracts teams preparing high-volume personalised document sets
- Operations teams replacing fragile mail-merge workflows with a repeatable process
- Small organisations that can't justify a cloud document-automation subscription

## What Can You Do Today?

- Load an Excel workbook, a Word `.docx` template, and an optional email template
- Search existing variables or create new ones directly in the mapping tables
- Build output filenames from workbook fields with a live first-row preview
- Generate DOCX, PDF, and email drafts for every row in one run
- Open, inspect, and share results directly from the app
- Save your project setup and reload it next time

### Install Instructions

**Windows (`.exe`)**

1. Download `DocGen-Studio-Setup-0.4.1.exe`.
2. Double-click the installer.
3. Follow the setup wizard and launch Doc Gen Studio from the Start menu.

**Linux AppImage**

```bash
chmod +x ./docgen-studio-0.4.1-x86_64.AppImage
./docgen-studio-0.4.1-x86_64.AppImage
```

On Ubuntu or Debian, AppImage may require `libfuse2`:

```bash
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

**Ubuntu / Debian (`.deb`)**

```bash
sudo apt install ./docgen-studio-0.4.1-amd64.deb
```

If `apt` prints a warning about downloading unsandboxed as root for a local file, that is an `apt` local-file warning, not a Doc Gen Studio packaging issue.

**Fedora / RHEL (`.rpm`)**

```bash
sudo dnf install ./docgen-studio-0.4.1-x86_64.rpm
```

**Arch Linux (`.pacman`)**

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./docgen-studio-0.4.1-x64.pacman
```
